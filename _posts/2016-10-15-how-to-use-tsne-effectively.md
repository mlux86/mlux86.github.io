title: How to use t-SNE effectively
comments: true

I often use [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) for projects at work. It's a great technique
for dimensionality reduction and visualization. As it puts a particular focus on forming groups, it
is suited as a pre-processing step for clustering high-dimensional data. For example, I once used it
to generate genome clusters of a metagenome ([more info](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280500)).

Every so often, when presenting plots generated by t-SNE, questions arise on how to interpret those
results. As an example, people commonly apply
[PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) and want to know how to interpret
the axes of t-SNE visualizations. In PCA, the axes are the chosen principal components, but in t-SNE
they are meaningless. And as soon as you dive deeper into t-SNE, more questions (and possibly
misinterpretations!) will arise. For example, tuning hyper-parameters is crucial and one has to be
aware of their big influence on the resulting representation.

In this context, I was delighted to see that [Distill](http://distill.pub/) took the effort and
applied t-SNE to a bunch of toy examples and interactively visualized the results.

[How to Use t-SNE Effectively](http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) is a great article, and
I advise everyone using this technique to read it!
