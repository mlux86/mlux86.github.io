title: Single-cell genome contamination detection
---

It took a while but I'm happy to share my recent paper titled

__acdc â€“ Automated Contamination Detection and Confidence estimation for single-cell genome data__

* It is available as an [open-access article at BMC Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-016-1397-7).

* Accompanying software is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/mlux86/acdc).

* A try-out version is available at [BiBiServ](https://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/acdc).
