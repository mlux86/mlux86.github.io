Hi, I'm Markus, passionate software engineer, computer and data scientist.

At Bielefeld University, I studied computer science, intelligent systems and did a PhD on the topic of unsupervised machine learning for large scale single-cell data. My dissertation ([slides](files/disputation.pdf)) is available [here](https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/2919673).

As of September 2018, I am a senior software engineer for function development at [Continental](https://www.continental-corporation.com/en) in Frankfurt am Main, being part of a team working on predictive models for advanced driver assistance systems.
